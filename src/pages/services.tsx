          East Asian Medicine (EAM) is an ancient system of healing that evolved
          over thousands of years. It includes acupuncture, herbal medicine,
          manual techniques, moxibustion, and nutrition counseling. The emphasis
          in East Asian Medicine lies in understanding the root causes of
          illness and imbalances in our bodies.

        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ color: 'common.white' }} paragraph>
          EAM treatments have been used for centuries to alleviate pain, treat
          disease, and improve general health. Clinical research shows that EAM
          treats physical ailments and can reduce the risk of developing them in
          the future. East Asian medicine is personalized â€“ what works for one
          person may not work for another because our bodies and life
          experiences are unique. Because East Asian treatment is so tailored,
          safe, and minimally invasive, it benefits people of all ages and all
          health situations.
